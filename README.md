## **Project Title:** # Forecasting-Antimalarial-Drug-Needs

---
## **Project Overview:**

The JenkinsPremierProject is dedicated to forecasting the demand for antimalarial drugs in Africa, addressing the critical public health challenge posed by malaria, especially among children under the age of five. Accurate demand forecasting is essential for effective resource allocation and strategic planning, ensuring that life-saving treatments are readily available where they are needed most


---
## **Objective:**
The primary objective is to accurately forecast the demand for antimalarial drugs in Africa, improving resource allocation and timely responses to reduce child mortality rates due to malaria. This involves leveraging AI technologies to develop predictive models that consider socio-economic, environmental, and health-related factors.
The goal is to provide robust predictions of antimalarial drug requirements across the continent.
This entails modeling complex variables affecting drug demand, such as seasonal outbreaks, population growth, and healthcare access improvements.

- The dataset contains various columns related to malaria indicators, population demographics, and healthcare infrastructure.
- A total of 26 columns are present, with columns such as:
  - Subdomain
  - ISO
  - Countries and areas
  - Key
  - UNICEF Reporting Region
  - UNICEF Programme Region
  - World Bank Income Group (2022)
  - Year
  - Population_growth(%)
  - % of children under age 5 with fever
  ... (& other columns)

    ## **Our Methodology:**
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features and transforming existing ones.
3. **Model Selection:** Choosing appropriate machine learning models for prediction.
4. **Model Training:** Training the selected models on the dataset.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluating the models' performance using metrics such as R-squared.

6. ## **Technologies Used:**
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Flask
- 
## **Results:**
- Ridge Regression: R-squared = 0.999
... (other models and their performance metrics)

## **Conclusion:**
The JenkinsPremierProject demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques to forecast antimalarial drug needs in Africa. Accurate predictions can help healthcare organizations and policymakers make informed decisions and allocate resources effectively.
